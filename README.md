A **Caesar Cipher** is a basic encryption method named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to send secret messages. It involves shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This method is easy to implement and understand but offers minimal security because the number of possible shifts (26 for English) is small and easily deciphered.

A **Cipher** is a broader term referring to any algorithm used to encrypt or decrypt information. It transforms readable data, known as plaintext, into an unreadable format, called ciphertext, to protect it from unauthorized access. Ciphers can range from simple substitutions like the Caesar Cipher to complex modern algorithms used in digital encryption to secure data in computing and communication systems.
